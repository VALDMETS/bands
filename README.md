# SCHLUBB'S BBQ

http://schlubbs.surge.sh/

This app is designed for an imaginary music venue, in which users vote on bands to play a show. It uses the open API from spotify for band data, along with a server hosted by www.kinvey.com for voting and user authentication data.

I built this application primarily using HTML, JavaScript, Sass, backbone.js, react.js. 

Features:
* User login/logout/signup capability
* Toggle voting system which allows users to vote for each artist only once
* Seamless integration of a third-party API for search functionality
* Responsive styling for mobile devices
* Cool neon effect on the logo
